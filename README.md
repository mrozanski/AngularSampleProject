ANGULAR 1.6 SAMPLE PROJECT
==========================

Live version: https://mrozanski.github.io/AngularSampleProject/


I did this as part of a job application process.

I used this exercise to explore Angular 1.5 components (my previous experience was with 1.4).

As unusual with Angular online documentation, there is extense literature with plenty of different approaches regarding use of framework features, folder structures, techniques in general for Angular 1.5.

My personal choices were affected by what parts of what I knew already I wanted to stick to (light controllers, readability, scalable structure) and which ones I wanted to experiment with (ES6 classes, Imports, reusable components, routing with states and components).

Please checkout my TODO with all the the good stuff I whish I could have included (but deprioritized because time is always a factor).
